**Objective**: Build a real estate price prediction website.

**Data Source**: Utilize the Bangalore home prices dataset from Kaggle.com.

**Modeling**:
- Use Python's sklearn library for linear regression to predict home prices.
- Perform data cleaning, outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, and dimensionality reduction.
- Apply GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning and k-fold cross-validation to validate the model.
  
**Server Setup**:
- Develop a Python Flask server to handle HTTP requests with the saved prediction model.
  
**User Interface**:
- Create a website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Allow users to input home characteristics (e.g., square footage, number of bedrooms) to receive price predictions.
  
**Technologies and Tools**:
- Python for backend logic, including data cleaning and model building.
- Numpy and Pandas for data manipulation.
- Matplotlib for data visualization.
- Sklearn for constructing the prediction model.
- Jupyter Notebook, Visual Studio Code, and PyCharm as Integrated Development Environments (IDEs).
- Flask for setting up the HTTP server.
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript for frontend development.
